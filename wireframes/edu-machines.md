1. The Core Thesis
Traditional ed-tech sells content; what the world needs are systems that manufacture human capital.

Input: A random person with 2/10 ability.
Output: A 6/10 practitioner who can ship real work and get paid.
Constraint: Must work at scale, anywhere, for cheap.
Anything short of that—AI flash-card apps, chat-based homework helpers, etc.—is “sprinkles on a broken cake” 1.

2. Why AI Changes the Equation Now
Generation, not retrieval: LLMs can create infinite, context-targeted exercises and projects.
Instant, scalable feedback: Code reviews, design critiques, copy rewrites in seconds.
Dynamic sequencing: A/B test learning paths in real time and keep only the versions that move completion & placement rates.
Cheap labor substitution: If the machine can evaluate portfolio projects as well as a $200/hr senior dev, the economics of 1-on-1 mentorship suddenly work at cohort scale 1.
3. Anatomy of an “Education Machine”
Farza proposes four tightly coupled layers:

Layer	Purpose	Example Metric
Curriculum Engine	Generates & sequences projects that force the right concept at the right time.	≥70 % of learners can deploy a full-stack CRUD app in ≤8 weeks.
Assessment Engine	Auto-scores code quality, design, writing, video submissions.	Correlation ≥0.85 with human-expert grade.
Community Engine	Peer pressure, accountability, network effects.	≥60 % daily active during weeks 4-8 (the typical drop-off cliff).
Credential Engine	Proves to employers the learner can ship.	≥40 % of grads land paid work within 90 days.
Fail any one layer and the machine jams 1.

4. Democratizing the Ability to “Become Something”
The biggest unlock isn’t U.S. suburbs; it’s a 19-year-old in Lagos or Lahore who can’t afford college but can afford a $200 cohort that guarantees income-share only if they get hired. The first company to nail the 2→6 jump at global price parity effectively exports American median income potential anywhere with Wi-Fi 1.
