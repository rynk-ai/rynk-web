### The Problem We Solve
Traditional AI chatbots give you walls of text. But learning isn't one-size-fits-all. Some concepts need step-by-step guides. Others need interactive quizzes. History needs timelines. Decisions need comparisons.

### What is Rynk?
Rynk is an AI-native learning and research platform that transforms any conversation into the format you actually need.

**Adaptive Surfaces**: One question, infinite formats. Ask anything and instantly transform the response into:
- 📚 **Courses** with chapters and progress tracking
- 🎯 **Quizzes** with scoring and explanations
- 🃏 **Flashcards** for memorization
- ⚖️ **Comparisons** with pros, cons, and recommendations
- 📅 **Timelines** for historical understanding
- 📖 **Wiki articles** for deep reference
- ✅ **Step-by-step guides** for practical tasks

**Context-Aware Memory**: Rynk remembers. Reference past conversations, group related topics in folders, and build on previous insights—your AI gets smarter with every interaction.

**Multi-Source Research**: For questions that need current information, Rynk orchestrates searches across Perplexity, Exa, and Wikipedia in parallel, synthesizing sources into cited, trustworthy answers.

**Deep Dive Conversations**: Select any part of an AI response and open a focused sub-conversation without losing your main thread.

### Feature Spotlight: Adaptive Surfaces
💡 Why do we accept one-size-fits-all AI responses?

When you ask ChatGPT about World War II, you get paragraphs.

But some of us need TIMELINES to understand history.
Others need FLASHCARDS to memorize key dates.
Students need QUIZZES to test their knowledge.

That's why we built Adaptive Surfaces in Rynk.

Same question. Your preferred format. One click.
