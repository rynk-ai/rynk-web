## Full Description

### 🎯 The Problem

You ask an AI for help learning React. You get 2000 words of text.

But what you *actually* needed was:
- A structured course to follow
- Flashcards to memorize syntax
- A quiz to test your knowledge
- A comparison of React vs Vue

**Traditional AI gives you information. Rynk gives you the *right format* for that information.**

---

### ✨ What is Rynk?

Rynk is an AI-native learning platform with **Adaptive Surfaces**—the ability to transform any AI response into the format that works best for you.

### 🎨 Why We Built This

We're learners ourselves. And we noticed that AI chatbots treat every question the same way—dump text and hope it helps.

But learning science tells us: **format matters**.
- Timelines help us understand sequences
- Flashcards leverage spaced repetition
- Quizzes create active recall
- Comparisons aid decision-making

So we built an AI that respects how humans actually learn.

### 💬 Maker's Story

> "I was learning about the French Revolution and got a 2000-word essay from ChatGPT. What I needed was a timeline. That frustration became Rynk."

## First Comment (Maker Comment)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Name], and I'm thrilled to launch Rynk today.

**The insight:** AI gives everyone the same format of response. But we don't all learn the same way.

Some of us are visual learners who need timelines.
Some of us need active quizzes to retain information.
Some of us need structured courses to stay motivated.

**The solution:** Adaptive Surfaces.

Ask anything → Get an answer → Transform it with one click into a course, quiz, flashcards, comparison, timeline, wiki, or guide.

We also built in:
- 🧠 Memory across conversations (finally!)
- 🔍 Multi-source research with citations
- 💬 Sub-chat deep dives on any text
- 🔗 Shareable conversation links

I'd love your feedback! What surfaces would you want to see next? How do you prefer to learn?

Thanks for checking us out!
